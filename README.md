To get this running correctly, make sure to use gitbash to clone this repository to your local file using: git clone https://github.com/kieranto1204/pandas-challenge.git
After doing that you will want to launch your jupyter notebook and then open up the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb file.
Then set your kernel to an existing jupyter server and use the one that started running when you openned your jupyter notebook, this should allow the code to run properly.

In this challenge we were tasked with created a variety of summaries for the passing rate of reading and math in a variety of schools, both district and charters.
We were tasked with creating a District Summary that contained the:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % of students who passed math
- % of students who passed reading
- % of students who passed both math and reading.

After getting the district summary created, we then needed to create a School Summary, which broke down the data by school.
This meant we had to create a new summary with:
- School
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % of students who passed math
- % of students who passed reading
- % of students who passed both math and reading

After creating both of these summaries we then needed to create dataframes for:
- Top 5 highest performing schools
- Top 5 lowest performing schools
- Math scores by grade
- Reading scores by grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type

After completing all of these challenges, we then had to create an analysis with at least 2 observable trends based on the data.

I got the starter code from the class github, and additionally used these websites for some extra help:
- Pandas - DataFrame Referene: https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_ref_dataframe.asp
- Pandas groupby() and count() with Examples: https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-groupby-count-examples/
